✍️ CNC Writing Machine – Merging Precision with Creativity 🛠️🧠
Excited to share a glimpse of our latest project — a custom-built CNC Writing Machine!
 This device brings automation to handwriting by precisely controlling pen movements over paper using stepper motors, rods, and a microcontroller setup.
🔧 Highlights:
DIY design using wood and 3D-printed components
Stepper motor-driven for X and Y-axis precision
Pen mechanism that mimics natural writing
Ideal for automated note-taking, artistic patterns, and educational purposes
💡 This was a hands-on learning journey combining mechanics, electronics, and programming — a true testament to the power of interdisciplinary engineering.
